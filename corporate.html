			  <p>The letters of this font are bold which helps it draw attention.  </p>

			  <p>on every page of this website the same navigation bar is visible, it shows the logo (which also leads to the index page) and links to every page on this website. All main titles are written in the same font and placed in the same header (except for the about and index page) for the body of the text the same font was used on every page. The colors and placement of the colors is also consistent throughout the website.</p>
            <li>The structure of the <strong>navigation and content</strong> (e.g. how content units are distributed across pages)</li>
			  <p>The structure of the navigation and content on the website is optimized for users experience and the access to information. At the top of the page, there is a navigation menu which can be used throughout the website to navigate through the pages. With the use of responsive design, the user is also able to use the buttons to find information more easily. This all will make it easier for the user to navigate on the website.</p>
            <li>All these elements must be justified by referring to the theory <strong>and/or vocabulary</strong> of design</li>
            <li>Please relate these elements to other units, for example:
              <ul>
                
				  <p>The web-design corresponds with the personality and brand. This is evident through the use of color scheme which portray the values described for Vandromeda. This is also observable in the copy and the features on this website. Included in the marketing and communication plan is the aim to encourage the van owners to join Vandromeda. This for the sharing of knowledge or the building of our community. The chosen color scheme and the written copy for the website and for the social media posts, contribute to this goal.
The community we are building is one of our main value propositions, and by combining the marketing/communication plan with the website we will make this reality.

<p class="roboto-regular">Persona</p>
<p class="roboto-regular">Noa is a 31 year old who loves travelling and loves to try out new things. She attaches great importance to safety, both in het daily as travel live. She tries to park her van on save campgrounds and always locks her door at night. Noa always checks the pictures on websites of campgrounds, to see if it is well-lit. But from experience she found out, sometimes pictures are misleading as they are brightened for the website.
She has been working as an online marketing specialist for a few year now. For both her work and personal life she spends a lot of time on Instagram, Facebook and TikTok. Because she doesn’t have to stay in the same place for work, she decided to start campervanning 14 months ago. She did a lot of research before buying a campervan, to make sure she made the right investment. None of het current friends are into camping, so it was difficult to get trust worthy tips. She tried to get into certain Facebook groups to ask for tips, but there were not many helpful groups for starters. As someone who did not have a lot of knowledge of campervanning at the start she did not always feel respected in these groups.
Noa is a social person who loves meeting new people, she always tries to have a chat to her neighbours on the camp ground. She did meet a few people in her early travels, but it is hard to stay in touch when you are travelling different parts of the continent. 
On a regular day Noa usually starts the day by checking her social media apps for messages. Depending on the activities in the area she will either sign up and get ready for an activity. If she finds a group activity, she will sometimes ask around if people want to join her, but usually people decline because they are scared of being scammed. On other days she will take a day to herself and go for a hike in the local nature. If Noa is looking into travelling to a different area, she likes to use the website to check out new places with a lot of activities in het interest. She is planning to see all the wonders Europe has to offer, and making a lot of friends on the way.

Chosen channels and platforms
Instagram
Instagram is a visual content platform that has started through being able to only post photos, and has evolved and modernized with features such as Reels or Stories. With a great user rate of around 1,4 billion in 2024 (Dixon, 2023), the Meta owned platform is a great fit to spread the message of the arrival of our platform. Furthermore, with its high engagement rate “59% of them (users) are on the platform daily” (Han et al., 2016), we believe that we will be able to reach our target audience easier through our account. Our target audience is camper vanners, men and women, in the age range of 25 to 35 years old, and 30,6% of the platform’s users (S. J. Dixon, 2023) are in our age demographic. Instagram algorithm tends to show the users posts based on their past interactions with specific accounts, posts or hashtags (Instagram, 2024), which assures us that our followers will be seeing our activity and will have a chance to react to them.
First of all, the highly visual appeal of Instagram is a crucial factor, as it allows us as a brand to create videos and pictures that are engaging and inspiring, and that can resonate with our audience. We have combined elements of designs such as fonts, shapes and colors from our style guide in our posts for them to be recognizable to our target, as well as following trends on Reels, to broaden our reach to new followers. The feature of “Stories” was also used, as polls,music, additional pictures and questions are integrable, and that aligns with our goal of “Build a community and stimulate interactivity between our social media profiles and our followers”. We have full access to see who interacts with our content, when or in what way, which helped us tremendously in tracking the behavior desired “Our followers actively engaging with the polls and QandA’s posted on Stories or integrated in feed posts.”, and the indicator “5 to 7 responses per poll/story/questions.”
Second of all, the engagement mediums present such as likes, comments, shares and direct messages are all interconnected with our goal of “Within the period of our campaign, we want to have active engagement with our audience.”. To further add, with their analytics tool, we are able to track in real time how the posts are performing, who they reach, how many people have reacted to them, and then determine if it aligns with our desired behavior of “Actively like, share and watch the content posted on our social media platforms.” and our indicator “An average of 15 to 20 likes per post on Instagram, 10-15 likes and 200-500 views per Tik Tok, with an average watch time of 3,5 to 5 seconds.”
Third of all, brand awareness is high on Instagram, taking into consideration their 1,4 billions of users, the platform could provide Vandromeda a vast reach. With the wish of duplicating the sense of community that is aimed through the platform, paired with the desire of reaching new possible users, the promotion of the website to a larger pool of camper van enthusiasts within the age range of 25 to 35 years old is possible. To be able to achieve this, the feature of hashtags came in very handy, as the number of posts under every tag was visible, as well the users being shown those posts when they decide to follow a specific hashtags. This aligns with the communication goal of “Reach new possible followers that may be interested in the Vandromeda platform.” and “Build an audience that is interested in the Vandromeda service and its arrival.” Analytics again came in handy, as the behaviors of “Reach non-followers in every post on Instagram'' and “The target audience decides to follow our social media platforms.”, and their indicators “Reach 3 to 7 non-followers per post on Instagram”, respectively “Gain 50 followers on Instagram”.
To conclude, the communication goals were what ultimately made us decide to settle on Instagram as the brand’s main social media platform. Engagement, interaction and building an audience interest, in combination with the visual appeal and the platform’s features, were crucial factors in the final decision of promoting Vandromeda on Instagram, in combination with their huge users, the daily users rate and the age range of the target audience.
Tik Tok
Tik Tok is the short-form video sharing platform that took the world by storm during the lockdowns of 2020. With a user base of 900,7 millions of followers estimated in 2024 (Ceci, 2023), its power in terms of trend creation, and its influence on how social media strategy is done , Vandromeda will clearly benefit from the promotion done on this platform. Albeit its low engagement rates of 11,97 on users with followers between 1,000 to 10,000 followers (Dencheva, 2024), their feature of the "For You" page has a huge influence in the music discovery process on the app. The algorithm is designed to identify and predict user preferences, recommending tailored content based on past interactions.(Warme et al., n.d.)
Our target audience is camper vanners, men and women, in the age range of 25 to 35 years old, and 32,6% (Ceci, 2024) of the platform’s users are in our age demographic.
First of all, Tik Tok has an interesting approach, as it displays an unique format of short, snappy and engaging videos, which has been proven to be appealing to multiple audiences. In a world where campervan owners are always on the road and may not always have a lot of spare time on their hands, this is a great chance to reach them easily. This is in direct correlation with our goal of “Within the period of our campaign, we want to have active engagement with our audience.”, the behavior desired “Actively like, share and watch the content posted on our social media platforms.”. The indicator “200-500 views per Tik Tok, with an average watch time of 3,5 to 5 seconds.” is easily trackable through the Analytics tool of TikTok, which also has helpful resources such as Inspiration or Creator Academy, which teaches users specific strategies for posting. We have also taken advantage of those tools, to further see what is trending and what can be done in terms of content ideas. Furthermore, the platform puts great emphasis on showcasing creativity, niche targeting and a sense of authenticity, which aligns with our target audience of free spirited campervan owners, who are travel enjoyers, as well as passionate about the uniqueness of the van lifestyle.
Second of all, TikTok as a means of social media possesses a great power of making content go viral through sounds and popular hashtags. Traveling has always been popular on social media, but this only has been amplified by ByteDance’s platform, which fits great with the theme of our platform and its content. To expand even more, the algorithm is especially designed for niche targeting, as it does not push content that is already popular, but it focuses on the behavior of the users, their interests and their interactions with what id displayed on the “For You” page. This directly connects with our goal of “Reach new possible followers that may be interested in the Vandromeda platform.” as it is helped by the algorithm itself, through the usage of hashtags and video templates. The desired behavior is “ To have non-followers profile views on TikTok”, with the indicator of “Gaining 3 to 5 non-followers profile views on Tik Tok”.
Third of all, this platform promotes creativity and showcasing aesthetics, which is aligning with our feature of displaying campervan locations and their beauty. Furthermore, tips, tricks and insights are always a trend, and are continuously evolving in the travel niche, which is great promotion for our service. This aspect directly aligns with our goal of “Building an audience that is interested in the Vandromeda service and its arrival.”, with the desired behavior of “The target audience decides to follow our social media platforms.” By posting aesthetically pleasing videos of locations, showcasing the van life and tips and tricks, we believe that we will be able to attract followers. The indicator for this particular goal is “To gain 20 followers on Tik Tok '', which will be measured via their followers counter.
To conclude, TikTok was chosen as a secondary platform for promotion, as it hosts our audience and promotes the principles that will for sure reach them. Short form video content has taken the social media promotion world by storm, with its snappy nature and appeal, which Vandromeda as a brand can make use of to its advantage. Furthermore, it also aligns with the communication goals, which will help to gain exposure and subscribers for Vandromeda.
