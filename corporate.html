			  <p>The letters of this font are bold which helps it draw attention.  </p>

			  <p>on every page of this website the same navigation bar is visible, it shows the logo (which also leads to the index page) and links to every page on this website. All main titles are written in the same font and placed in the same header (except for the about and index page) for the body of the text the same font was used on every page. The colors and placement of the colors is also consistent throughout the website.</p>
            <li>The structure of the <strong>navigation and content</strong> (e.g. how content units are distributed across pages)</li>
			  <p>The structure of the navigation and content on the website is optimized for users experience and the access to information. At the top of the page, there is a navigation menu which can be used throughout the website to navigate through the pages. With the use of responsive design, the user is also able to use the buttons to find information more easily. This all will make it easier for the user to navigate on the website.</p>
            <li>All these elements must be justified by referring to the theory <strong>and/or vocabulary</strong> of design</li>
            <li>Please relate these elements to other units, for example:
              <ul>
                
				  <p>The web-design corresponds with the personality and brand. This is evident through the use of color scheme which portray the values described for Vandromeda. This is also observable in the copy and the features on this website. Included in the marketing and communication plan is the aim to encourage the van owners to join Vandromeda. This for the sharing of knowledge or the building of our community. The chosen color scheme and the written copy for the website and for the social media posts, contribute to this goal.
The community we are building is one of our main value propositions, and by combining the marketing/communication plan with the website we will make this reality.

<p class="roboto-regular">Persona</p>
<p class="roboto-regular">Noa is a 31 year old who loves travelling and loves to try out new things. She attaches great importance to safety, both in het daily as travel live. She tries to park her van on save campgrounds and always locks her door at night. Noa always checks the pictures on websites of campgrounds, to see if it is well-lit. But from experience she found out, sometimes pictures are misleading as they are brightened for the website.
She has been working as an online marketing specialist for a few year now. For both her work and personal life she spends a lot of time on Instagram, Facebook and TikTok. Because she doesn’t have to stay in the same place for work, she decided to start campervanning 14 months ago. She did a lot of research before buying a campervan, to make sure she made the right investment. None of het current friends are into camping, so it was difficult to get trust worthy tips. She tried to get into certain Facebook groups to ask for tips, but there were not many helpful groups for starters. As someone who did not have a lot of knowledge of campervanning at the start she did not always feel respected in these groups.
Noa is a social person who loves meeting new people, she always tries to have a chat to her neighbours on the camp ground. She did meet a few people in her early travels, but it is hard to stay in touch when you are travelling different parts of the continent. 
On a regular day Noa usually starts the day by checking her social media apps for messages. Depending on the activities in the area she will either sign up and get ready for an activity. If she finds a group activity, she will sometimes ask around if people want to join her, but usually people decline because they are scared of being scammed. On other days she will take a day to herself and go for a hike in the local nature. If Noa is looking into travelling to a different area, she likes to use the website to check out new places with a lot of activities in het interest. She is planning to see all the wonders Europe has to offer, and making a lot of friends on the way.

<p class="roboto-regular">Indicators: Gain 70 followers across our Tik Tok and Instagram accounts (50 followers on Instagram, 20 on Tik Tok)</p>
<p class="roboto-regular">Chosen channels and platforms</p>
<p class="roboto-regular">Instagram
Instagram is a visual content platform that has started through being able to only post photos, and has evolved and modernized with features such as Reels or Stories. With a great user rate of around 1,4 billion in 2024 (Dixon, 2023), the Meta owned platform is a great fit to spread the message of the arrival of our platform. Furthermore, with its high engagement rate “59% of them (users) are on the platform daily” (Han et al., 2016), we believe that we will be able to reach our target audience easier through our account. Our target audience is camper vanners, men and women, in the age range of 25 to 35 years old, and 30,6% of the platform’s users (S. J. Dixon, 2023) are in our age demographic. Instagram algorithm tends to show the users posts based on their past interactions with specific accounts, posts or hashtags (Instagram, 2024), which assures us that our followers will be seeing our activity and will have a chance to react to them.</p>
<p class="roboto-regular">First of all, the highly visual appeal of Instagram is a crucial factor, as it allows us as a brand to create videos and pictures that are engaging and inspiring, and that can resonate with our audience. We have combined elements of designs such as fonts, shapes and colors from our style guide in our posts for them to be recognizable to our target, as well as following trends on Reels, to broaden our reach to new followers. The feature of “Stories” was also used, as polls,music, additional pictures and questions are integrable, and that aligns with our goal of “Build a community and stimulate interactivity between our social media profiles and our followers”. We have full access to see who interacts with our content, when or in what way, which helped us tremendously in tracking the behavior desired “Our followers actively engaging with the polls and QandA’s posted on Stories or integrated in feed posts.”, and the indicator “5 to 7 responses per poll/story/questions.”</p>
<p class="roboto-regular">Second of all, the engagement mediums present such as likes, comments, shares and direct messages are all interconnected with our goal of “Within the period of our campaign, we want to have active engagement with our audience.”. To further add, with their analytics tool, we are able to track in real time how the posts are performing, who they reach, how many people have reacted to them, and then determine if it aligns with our desired behavior of “Actively like, share and watch the content posted on our social media platforms.” and our indicator “An average of 15 to 20 likes per post on Instagram, 10-15 likes and 200-500 views per Tik Tok, with an average watch time of 3,5 to 5 seconds.”</p>
<p class="roboto-regular">Third of all, brand awareness is high on Instagram, taking into consideration their 1,4 billions of users, the platform could provide Vandromeda a vast reach. With the wish of duplicating the sense of community that is aimed through the platform, paired with the desire of reaching new possible users, the promotion of the website to a larger pool of camper van enthusiasts within the age range of 25 to 35 years old is possible. To be able to achieve this, the feature of hashtags came in very handy, as the number of posts under every tag was visible, as well the users being shown those posts when they decide to follow a specific hashtags. This aligns with the communication goal of “Reach new possible followers that may be interested in the Vandromeda platform.” and “Build an audience that is interested in the Vandromeda service and its arrival.” Analytics again came in handy, as the behaviors of “Reach non-followers in every post on Instagram'' and “The target audience decides to follow our social media platforms.”, and their indicators “Reach 3 to 7 non-followers per post on Instagram”, respectively “Gain 50 followers on Instagram”.</p>
<p class="roboto-regular">To conclude, the communication goals were what ultimately made us decide to settle on Instagram as the brand’s main social media platform. Engagement, interaction and building an audience interest, in combination with the visual appeal and the platform’s features, were crucial factors in the final decision of promoting Vandromeda on Instagram, in combination with their huge users, the daily users rate and the age range of the target audience.</p>
<p class="roboto-regular">Tik Tok</p>
<p class="roboto-regular">Tik Tok is the short-form video sharing platform that took the world by storm during the lockdowns of 2020. With a user base of 900,7 millions of followers estimated in 2024 (Ceci, 2023), its power in terms of trend creation, and its influence on how social media strategy is done , Vandromeda will clearly benefit from the promotion done on this platform. Albeit its low engagement rates of 11,97 on users with followers between 1,000 to 10,000 followers (Dencheva, 2024), their feature of the "For You" page has a huge influence in the music discovery process on the app. The algorithm is designed to identify and predict user preferences, recommending tailored content based on past interactions.(Warme et al., n.d.)
Our target audience is camper vanners, men and women, in the age range of 25 to 35 years old, and 32,6% (Ceci, 2024) of the platform’s users are in our age demographic.</p>
<p class="roboto-regular">First of all, Tik Tok has an interesting approach, as it displays an unique format of short, snappy and engaging videos, which has been proven to be appealing to multiple audiences. In a world where campervan owners are always on the road and may not always have a lot of spare time on their hands, this is a great chance to reach them easily. This is in direct correlation with our goal of “Within the period of our campaign, we want to have active engagement with our audience.”, the behavior desired “Actively like, share and watch the content posted on our social media platforms.”. The indicator “200-500 views per Tik Tok, with an average watch time of 3,5 to 5 seconds.” is easily trackable through the Analytics tool of TikTok, which also has helpful resources such as Inspiration or Creator Academy, which teaches users specific strategies for posting. We have also taken advantage of those tools, to further see what is trending and what can be done in terms of content ideas. Furthermore, the platform puts great emphasis on showcasing creativity, niche targeting and a sense of authenticity, which aligns with our target audience of free spirited campervan owners, who are travel enjoyers, as well as passionate about the uniqueness of the van lifestyle.</p>
<p class="roboto-regular">Second of all, TikTok as a means of social media possesses a great power of making content go viral through sounds and popular hashtags. Traveling has always been popular on social media, but this only has been amplified by ByteDance’s platform, which fits great with the theme of our platform and its content. To expand even more, the algorithm is especially designed for niche targeting, as it does not push content that is already popular, but it focuses on the behavior of the users, their interests and their interactions with what id displayed on the “For You” page. This directly connects with our goal of “Reach new possible followers that may be interested in the Vandromeda platform.” as it is helped by the algorithm itself, through the usage of hashtags and video templates. The desired behavior is “ To have non-followers profile views on TikTok”, with the indicator of “Gaining 3 to 5 non-followers profile views on Tik Tok”.</p>
<p class="roboto-regular">Third of all, this platform promotes creativity and showcasing aesthetics, which is aligning with our feature of displaying campervan locations and their beauty. Furthermore, tips, tricks and insights are always a trend, and are continuously evolving in the travel niche, which is great promotion for our service. This aspect directly aligns with our goal of “Building an audience that is interested in the Vandromeda service and its arrival.”, with the desired behavior of “The target audience decides to follow our social media platforms.” By posting aesthetically pleasing videos of locations, showcasing the van life and tips and tricks, we believe that we will be able to attract followers. The indicator for this particular goal is “To gain 20 followers on Tik Tok '', which will be measured via their followers counter.</p>
<p class="roboto-regular">To conclude, TikTok was chosen as a secondary platform for promotion, as it hosts our audience and promotes the principles that will for sure reach them. Short form video content has taken the social media promotion world by storm, with its snappy nature and appeal, which Vandromeda as a brand can make use of to its advantage. Furthermore, it also aligns with the communication goals, which will help to gain exposure and subscribers for Vandromeda.

          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <ol>This campaign has been truly an eye opening experience for the entire team, as we had to build it from the ground up, which proved to be a great opportunity to learn and evolve in this field.
<li> We have learned that the intention behind every post is truly an important aspect that can be easily overlooked while considering the looks of a picture/video, the caption, hashtags, hour of posting etc. The message that is being expressed matters to the consumer and it can easily influence their behavior , from ignorance to actually interacting with a post by liking, commenting or sharing. Although we have tried to have a clear intention behind each post, there were moments we have been distracted by trends or visual appeal, which has been a great learning experience: Posts should be created based on intention and message, and then the visuals should be built based on that, rather than choosing what can look best. What we would do differently is build some categories of content (QandA on stories, Given Advice, Location of the week etc), see the intention behind each of them, see how they could intrigue and help our followers and post with more attention than we did so far.</li>
<li>Reaching the audience can feel easy in some times, and difficult in other times. Some posts did better than others, in terms of likes, reach, which can be both motivating and demoralizing at the same time, in accordance to the results obtained. At the end of the day, perfection is unachievable, and some posts are bound to outperform others, what is important is to notice patterns and gather insights in what works and what does not. What we would do differently is do a testing trial, notice patterns, understand what works best, and stick to it. Additionally, once a few months, we would introduce new content, test that itself, as well as monitor what we already have, see how it performs, and ultimately decide if we should stick to it, try to refresh and revive it, or just simply, give up on it. To expand, we would also not compare ourselves and get swooned about what other brands are performing, at the end of they day, each audience has its own magic, and the right people will choose our platform at the end of the day, because it reflects their interests and passion.</li>
<li>Posting hours are very important in the performance of a post itself. We have tried everything from noon, to evening, to the morning hours and saw what performed the best and what did not. If we were to change something, we would post solely during the noon, around 12 AM, as that represents a break moment for most people, where they stop for a second, have lunch, and then check out their social media. Evenings also outperformed, as an example, our highest liked Tik Tok, which contained the sad mouse trend, was posted around 7PM, which offered visibility to it, as our target audience and new audiences had the time to spare on social media and get our video displayed on their “For You’ pages. If we could do something differently, is to split Instagram Feed posts and short form video content to be posted in the evening, and then stories to be posted during noon, to assure maximum visibility and performance. Unfortunately, posting around midday (2-5 PM), did not exactly work and has not benefited us in any shape or form. To expand, we have noticed Monday at noon time, a post with an encouraging message really got our followers engaged, which is a pattern that can be reused once a few months.</li>
<li>Tik Tok’s algorithm is very hard to anticipate, and as easy as it may seem to go viral from the outskirts, the reality looks vastly different. We have tried to build our content around the content we wanted to implement on our website, as well as did a few trendy pieces. One thing that we have learned is that riding the wave of a trend builds engagement on that particular post, but does not gain actual dedicated followers of our service/of our Tik Tok account. Due to its algorithm and the fast pace nature of the platform itself, the users tend to be very distracted by the overwhelming amount of content, and the intent behind a follow on this specific social media has to be genuine interest. Furthermore, we have noticed better engagement and follower count was organic when we posted things such as QandA, or how van life would be like. We also posted another trend, which did not drive us really any engagement, and has taught us a valuable lesson: it is better to be consistent with the type of content that aligns with the authenticity of the brand, and a trend from time to time it does help, but it needs to be adaptation to fit exactly what the brand is about. What we would do differently is stick to a more regular, daily regime of posting, keeping track and actively using trending sounds available, and lastly, explore the usage of even more hashtags.</li>
<li>Planning has to be more rigid, which is a good lesson to have in the future. We had some issues, as the first week of the project dedicated for social media had zero posts from our side, due to a rebranding and changing everything from the logo to the color palette, while also having our account banned multiple times by Instagram, or even not being allowed to create one at all, which made our process harder and tiring. Thankfully, we created a dedicated email and discovered that the problem was connected with the age policy on Instagram. If a user already has other accounts connected, the platform does not require the birthday, as it extracts it from the other accounts already existent, but that was not the case. When we get to finalize that process, we started posting. Planning can be overwhelming at times, as there is some advice that posting daily is better, other parties say it is not. We have noticed that posting daily might create a slight fatigue to the user and the algorithm, compared to posting once a few days, which worked better by far, for the feed at least. When stories were posted back to back, we noticed a higher engagement from our follower base. If we were to do something different, is to test the first two weeks, one posting everyday, and one posting once every 2-3 days, see what works best, and stick to that. mFurthermore, we would plan posts more rigorously and try to be more strategic about what to post, when and how that would affect our reach to both followers and non followers.</li>
<li>The inspiration tools offered by Instagram and Tik Tok can be useful and are not talked about enough. We have discovered them while navigating the analytics tool, and they proved to be there for a good reason. Unfortunately, at first, we did not pay much attention to them , as we were focused on creating our posts around the content of Vandromeda as a brand. While we still believe in that way of thinking, it is important to see what those platforms recommend, as it is based on what works, how the algorithm works, and ultimately, the platform will push the content made based on their recommendation, to gain exposure for their new feature. If we could something different, we would, from the get go, explore the inspirations feature, take the advice that is given there, and start planning, and creating our trend around what works, so we could gain more exposure from non followers, accompanied by the content of our platform, so we get engagement from our existing followers.</li>
</ol>
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>Vandromeda is not stopping, and with that, the promotional activities are following suit. Future planning for social media is essential, and we are striving to grow our platform.
Firstly, we would create multiple categories of content that would appear regularly on our account, thus to establish an identity for our social media platforms and to be more recognizable. As an example, we would have a monthly location spotlight, that would have a dedicated post on Instagram, that would be made of information, tips, and advice, accompanied by some pictures of the location. Furthermore, on our stories, we would open a box of questions for our followers, for them to tell us their curiosities, and another one, where they can share their experiences of that location, whether positive or negative, in a means to remain authentic and transparent, in alignment with our values. Another idea would be to have a monthly series of stories , titled “It wasn’t that Vantastic” where our audience will have the chance to tell us a funny story about their experience as a camper vanner, and the five best ones will be picked and posted. We want to improve our interactivity with our followers, thus build on our connection with them, and that would lead to a more stable users base. This is a great chance to do some “Word of mouth” marketing, as customers are more inclined to recommend a product if they have trust in its quality, enjoy its advantages and have a good experience using the product. To expand, this type of content is easily shareable via social media, which can lead to our content being exposed to new audiences.
</p>
          <p>Secondly, we would introduce a mascot to our social media platforms, named Anna, which is actually our persona. We believe that, by introducing our mascot, which is directly inspired by our target audience and represents the profile of our customer, she will be more credible and will take on an “Influencer” status for our online communities. At the end of day, she is the peer of our followers. The traditional way would opt for a more standard option, such as a celebrity endorsement, but that does not stand for us, as it would feel inauthentic. Everybody knows that famous people live a lifestyle to a whole other level, including mansions, which is the complete opposite of our audience’s vision of their ideal lifestyle, and we want to avoid this type of clash, as it would not align with our vision or what we stand for. Furthermore, studies show that celebrities endorsements are not as effective as they used to be, and they can even cause the public to stray away from the product itself “(...)recent studies have found a negative effect of using celebrities as a product endorser. When audiences view the advertising presented by a famous celebrity who appears everywhere, eventually the effectiveness of the advertising will diminish, paralleled by the disinterest of the audience due to perceived overkill. As a result, audiences will not be interested in the product.”(Pairoa and Arunrangsiwed, 2016). After gathering this knowledge, we decided to make Anna our mascot, and to debut her on our social media. After all, we do strive to have a sense of community on our platform, and our social media would be the perfect place to launch her. Her design has to be carefully crafted and we will do our best to also integrate her in mediums such as gifs or stickers, to give her a sense of perceived emotions, to connect her with the watcher "(...) brands mascots in social network sticker sets can strengthen user identity through emotional affinity, rather than through a physical similarity. Well designed cartoon representations displaying realistic human emotions can communicate that emotion. This supports our suggestions that audiences or social network users could perceive emotion from brand mascot better than human endorsers." (Pairoa and Arunrangsiwed, 2016).
We do want to make her “human-like”, by writing the captions from a 1st person perspective, and her having her own recommendations/opinions. Anna would have her own segments, such as Ask Anna, which would be a monthly QandA session available on our Instagram Stories and Tik Tok comments, where our followers would get to ask anything as they please, from functionalities of our platforms, restaurant recommendations in certain locations to best rated camper van parking spots in any country. Anna also would appear in our posts, presenting different tourist attractions, and also in our Tik Tok. This also can align with a possible future feature, where she will be your personal assistant, guiding you on our website. Anna is meant to be a personalization of our brand, as well as a symbol of it!
</p>
          <p>Another plan we have for our future posts is to collaborate with european camper van influencers, such as @the_sunnysidephil (from Germany,27,1k on Instagram), @mygrations.nl (Dutch, 6,3k on Instagram), @reisstelnl (Dutch, 14,7k on Instagram, 1,59k on Youtube ) @thosehappy_days (British, 19,6k on Instagram, 195k on youtube) to name a few. This decision was made based on the fact that consumers have started to notice marketing ploys and the intention behind them, which in turn, can hurt a brand as their efforts to maximize sales falls short due to the campaign’s lack of effectiveness and the customer’s growing awareness “Consumers’ growing skepticism toward traditional marketing has made it increasingly difficult for firms to attract and influence consumers.“(Leung et al., 2022). Knowing this information, we chose to go with the influencer rute, as they tend to be closer with their audiences, as they constantly share multiple details of their life in front of a camera, which is in direct correlation with the campervan lifestyle. Its effectiveness is indisputable as “Studies show that “90% of people with access to the Internet trust recommendations from social media influencers. Related to the effectiveness, 90% of marketers find Influencer marketing effective. (Influence Marketing Hub, 2021). Brands of all sorts are generating positive returns with Influencer marketing. The influencer marketing effectiveness is measured with ROI, and according to the surveys, a large portion (90%) of marketers find influencer marketing effective. “(DIMITRIESKA and EFREMOVA, 2021).
For our collaborations, we would like them to produce some content for our Instagram and Tik Tok, where they can showcase their best campervan tricks, their origin story, and their favorite locations to visit. Furthermore, we would also request Instagram stories where they link our platform, explain to their respective audiences the concept behind them, as well as inviting them to join. We will have a collaboration a month, as we want each influencer to have their time to shine, as well as for them to also do a take over of our stories for a day, for both TikTok and Instagram, where they can present a day in their life on the road, in real time. To expand, since most of the influencers listed are also active on Youtube, that is a certain opportunity for us to gain exposure from an audience that maybe does not use social media at all, but would love to get traveling advice easier, as well as to have a community of like minded people. We will be sponsoring some of their videos, in exchange of a content-integrated advertisement, or simply them mentioning and showing their usage of our website and how it influences their decisions.We believe this type of content can inspire our audiences, as well as entertain them through the audio-visual material we will be bringing to them. Influencer collaborations have been proven to be successful, as they've taken the world by storm in the last few years, from cooking to even camper van traveling.
</p>
				<p>Lastly, we will be doing more rigorous planning, to test further what works and when and how that could lead to us to the most optimum results. We will also be adding feedback moments, where our followers can communicate to us what could be done to better their experience, what kind of content they would like to see, when, and what does not work anymore/ what can be refreshed and reused.</p>

			  <li>•	It can be hard to find good recommendation in another country, most recommendations are very touristy and busy. There are a lot of websites out there with good recommendations, the only problem is they are the same everywhere.</li>
			  <li>It is not save meeting strangers from the internet, especially in foreign countries. The only solution currently out there is meeting in a crowded place.</li>
